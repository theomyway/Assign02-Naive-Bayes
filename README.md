Problem Solving Approach:
Documentation Of The SCKIT-LEARN and research work

Problems Faced:
We Tried Different Solutions like decomposition-NMF and preprocessing.MinMaxScaler But These Approches Didn't Worked So We Used abs() Function For The Negative Values Conversion Into Postive. We had problems uploading files to kaggle because our rows had negative values therefore we solved it through above code.
